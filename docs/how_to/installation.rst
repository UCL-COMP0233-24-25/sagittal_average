Installation
------------

To install this library, that's not yet on pypi you can do so by:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python -m venv brain
    $ . brain/bin/activate
    $ pip install git+git://github.com/UCL-COMP0233-24-25/sagittal_average


Then you'll be able to use on all your 2D brain data as:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sagittal_brain.run_averages("input_file.csv", "ouput_file.csv")


Have fun!
